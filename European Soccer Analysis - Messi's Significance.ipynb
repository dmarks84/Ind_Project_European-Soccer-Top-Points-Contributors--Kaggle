    "## European Soccer Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Who is the best player in Europe?  That's a tough question to answer.  If we just think about who scores the most goals, we might be weighting an impact cateogry that actually doesn't lead to team success.  Perhaps a defender, helping keep clean sheets, is in fact a \"better\" player than a striker who runs up a goal tally against weaker opponents.  So how could we measure this?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way would be to consider something like the \"Wins Above Replacement\" [WAR](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/advanced-stats/wins-above-replacement).  WAR measures a player's value in all facets of the game by deciphering how many more wins he's worth than a replacement-level player at his same position.  Another way to think about this would be to look at the average number of points a team earns (3 for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss) when a player is on the field vs. when they aren't.  For a single player, we can calculate these averages and determine if there is a statistically significant difference in these measures.  That's what we'll do here.  We'll start with the case of Lionel Messi, widely considered the best player of all time.  We can also run this analysis for all players in Europe, to whose team's on-field points average is most significnatly above their team's points average when they are not on the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll be using the European Soccer Database sourced from [Kaggle/Github](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer).  This data is stored ina  SQLite database, so the first steps in our analysis will involve connecting to the database, runnign queries on the included tables, and creating Pandas dataframes from the data."
